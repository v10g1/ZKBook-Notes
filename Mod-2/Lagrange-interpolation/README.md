Lagrange interpolation is a technique for computing a polynomial that passes through a set of n points.

A straight line through two points
Consider that if we have Two points they can be interpolated with a line. for example. (1,1) and (2,2)
we can say that the line is y=x

Now what if we have One point, we can draw a line thorugh that point with the degree 0 polynomial. for example, if the point is (3,5) we can draw a line throught it y=5
(which is a degree 0 polynomial)

## fuck it, gimme the summary
geez man chill out.

Lagrange interpolation is a direct formula to reconstruct the unique degree ≤ (n−1) polynomial that passes through n known points.

Li​(x)=j!=i∏​xi​−xj​/xi−xj​​

the finaly formula would be something like

P(x)=(i=0)∑(n−1)​yi​j!=i∏​xi​−xj​x−xj​​


yay!!
