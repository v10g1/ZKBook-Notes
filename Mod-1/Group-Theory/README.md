# 📘 Zero-Knowledge Book — Module 1 Notes

> Note: English is not my first language. These notes focus on clarity of concepts. These notes might not be the best for everyone to read However they do provide the quick glance/revision if anyone wants that.

## Trivial group
the Group which only contains {0} with the binary operator of addition
## Real numbers are not a group number multiplication
for it to be a group there need to be a inverse the inverse of 0 will be 1/0 which is not defiend

## Question
Integers (positive and negative) are not a group under multiplication. Show which of the four requirements (closed, associative, existence of identity, all elements having an inverse) are not satisfied.

Integers {..,-1,0,1,2,3,4...}
closed is okay
associative is okay
identity is there
inverse for 0 does not exist here

Go throught the other examples in the this chapter, i did not note them down because they are easily understandable
## Finite groups
limited number of elements

## Order of a group
number of elements in it

## Cyclic groups
A cyclic group is a group that has an element that every element in the group can be generated off of.

## Example of cyclic groups
- trivial group
- addition modulo 7 is a a cyclic group
- Multiplication modulo 7 is a cyclic group, if we exclude zero


-If a group is  cyclic then it is abelian

Cylic group don't have to be a arithematic modulo some prime number, but these are the only cyclic groups we will be using out discussion of zero knowledge proofs


A group cannot have more than on element which is identity

## Most important question
Where will this be used in ZKPs?
Will learn about this later.
